   abstract = {Current predictions of extinction risks from climate change vary widely depending on the specific assumptions and geographic and taxonomic focus of each study. I synthesized published studies in order to estimate a global mean extinction rate and determine which factors contribute the greatest uncertainty to climate change-induced extinction risks. Results suggest that extinction risks will accelerate with future global temperatures, threatening up to one in six species under current policies. Extinction risks were highest in South America, Australia, and New Zealand, and risks did not vary by taxonomic group. Realistic assumptions about extinction debt and dispersal capacity substantially increased extinction risks. We urgently need to adopt strategies that limit further climate change if we are to avoid an acceleration of global extinctions.},

   abstract = {Temperature and precipitation change more strongly in the Arctic than at lower latitudes, with central Arctic boreal winter precipitation projected to double in the 21st century in a high-emission scenario. This enhanced hydrological sensitivity has been explained in terms of the Arctic moisture budget and attributed to either moisture advection or surface evaporation. Here, we show that boreal winter moisture availability is less sensitive to surface temperature change in the Arctic than at lower latitudes, questioning a central role of the moisture budget. Hydrological sensitivity, that is, precipitation change per unit temperature change, is similar in models with or without sea-ice changes, suggesting a secondary role of surface flux changes. Instead, we propose that the Arctic's larger hydrological sensitivity is energetically driven. Increases in latent heat release from precipitation locally balance increased atmospheric radiative cooling in Arctic winter, consistent with process-level understanding of radiatively driven cloud and precipitation formation.},

   abstract = {There are multiple extreme events underway in the Arctic that are beyond previous records: rain in Greenland, Alaska weather variability, and ecosystem reorganizations in the Barents and the northern Bering Sea associated with climate change and sea-ice loss. Such unique extreme events represent a philosophical challenge for interpretation, i.e., a lack of statistical basis, as well as important information for regional adaptation to climate change. These changes are affecting regional food security, human/wildlife health, cultural activities, and marine wildlife conservation. Twenty years ago, the Arctic was more resilient to climate change than now, as sea ice had a broader extent and was three times thicker than today. These new states cannot be assigned probabilities because one cannot a priori conceive of these states. They often have no historical analogues. A way forward for adaptation to future extremes is through scenario/narrative approaches; a recent development in climate change policy is through decision making under deep uncertainty (DMDU).},

   abstract = {The Arctic is undergoing unprecedented transformations with implications for regional ecosystems, Indigenous communities, and global climate systems. Ocean heat transport, permafrost thawing, and ice–albedo interactions are some of the feedback mechanisms that contribute to the increase in average temperatures in the Arctic. These processes increase the risks associated with climate change globally by speeding up the loss of sea ice, changes in biodiversity, and greenhouse gas emissions. This review synthesises recent advances in Arctic climate science, focusing on the drivers and feedback mechanisms of Arctic amplification, its cascading impacts on ecosystems and socioeconomic systems, and emerging governance challenges. It highlights critical knowledge gaps, specifically regarding the importance of Indigenous knowledge and interdisciplinary approaches in climate adaptation strategies. This study emphasises the need for inclusive, transformative, and collaborative approaches by analysing governance frameworks, climate policies, and community resilience initiatives. Innovative adaptation strategies are suggested, such as ecosystem-based adaptations, climate-resilient infrastructure, and the switch to renewable energy to address these issues. Arctic-specific governance recommendations are proposed to develop sustainable solutions that preserve its ecology while reducing its global effects by filling research gaps and promoting international collaboration. The future of the Arctic is not merely a regional issue but also a global one, requiring swift and coordinated action to address climate challenges.},

   abstract = {<p> Monitoring breeding waterfowl populations with ground‐based pair and brood surveys informs management and conservation decisions. However, surveys are often limited temporally and may miss individuals that are not present or available for detection at the time of the survey. Alternative methods to monitor waterfowl such as camera traps may be more appropriate to measure relative abundance, but it is unknown how camera trap surveys compare to ground‐based surveys. We conducted concurrent walk‐up pair and brood surveys on 20 wetlands in Manitoba, Canada and deployed cameras set to take pictures at 10‐min intervals during daylight hours. We compared indices of relative abundance and species richness of ducks and ducklings on small prairie wetlands (&lt;3.8 ha) detected with ground‐based and camera trap surveys and make recommendations regarding the time of day and duration of camera surveys. As predicted, camera surveys detected more ducks, ducklings, and duck species than ground surveys counted. Importantly, camera surveys detected ducks and ducklings at wetlands that ground surveys did not. Both duck and duckling observations were positively associated between survey methods (ducks: R <sup>2</sup>  = 0.22, F <sub>1,17</sub>  = 4.83, <italic>P</italic>  = 0.04, ducklings: R <sup>2</sup>  = 0.49, F <sub>1,15</sub>  = 14.16, <italic>P</italic>  = 0.002).

We used 455 historical nest locations, 12 environmental abiotic predictor layers, Geographic Information System (ArcGIS), and TreeNet modeling software to create a spatially explicit model predicting gyrfalcon breeding distribution and population size across Alaska. The model predicted that 75% of the state had a relative gyrfalcon nest occurrence index value of <20% (where essentially no nests are expected to occur) and 7% of the state had a value of >60%. Areas of high predicted occurrence were in northern and western Alaska. The most important predictor variable was soil type, followed by sub-surface geology and vegetation type. Nine environmental factors were useful in predicting nest occurrence, indicating complex multivariate habitat relationships exist. We estimated the breeding gyrfalcon population in Alaska is 546 ± 180 pairs. The model was 67% accurate at predicting nest occurrence with an area under the curve score of 0.76 when assessed with independent data; this is a good result when considering its application to the entire state of Alaska. Prediction accuracy estimates were as high as 97% using 10-fold cross validation of the training data. The model helps guide science-based management efforts in times of increasing and global pressures for this species and Arctic landscapes. © Springer-Verlag 2009.},

   abstract = {Climate change will have far-reaching impacts on biodiversity, including increasing extinction rates. Current approaches to quantifying such impacts focus on measuring exposure to climatic change and largely ignore the biological differences between species that may significantly increase or reduce their vulnerability. To address this, we present a framework for assessing three dimensions of climate change vulnerability, namely sensitivity, exposure and adaptive capacity; this draws on species' biological traits and their modeled exposure to projected climatic changes. In the largest such assessment to date, we applied this approach to each of the world's birds, amphibians and corals (16,857 species). The resulting assessments identify the species with greatest relative vulnerability to climate change and the geographic areas in which they are concentrated, including the Amazon basin for amphibians and birds, and the central Indo-west Pacific (Coral Triangle) for corals. We found that high concentration areas for species with traits conferring highest sensitivity and lowest adaptive capacity differ from those of highly exposed species, and we identify areas where exposure-based assessments alone may over or under-estimate climate change impacts. We found that 608-851 bird (6-9%), 670-933 amphibian (11-15%), and 47-73 coral species (6-9%) are both highly climate change vulnerable and already threatened with extinction on the IUCN Red List. The remaining highly climate change vulnerable species represent new priorities for conservation. Fewer species are highly climate change vulnerable under lower IPCC SRES emissions scenarios, indicating that reducing greenhouse emissions will reduce climate change driven extinctions. Our study answers the growing call for a more biologically and ecologically inclusive approach to assessing climate change vulnerability. By facilitating independent assessment of the three dimensions of climate change vulnerability, our approach can be used to devise species and area-specific conservation interventions and indices. The priorities we identify will strengthen global strategies to mitigate climate change impacts. © 2013 Foden et al.},

   abstract = {Intra- and inter-specific resource partitioning within predator communities is a fundamental component of trophic ecology, and one proposed mechanism for how populations partition resources is through individual niche variation. The Niche Variation Hypothesis (NVH) predicts that inter-individual trait variation leads to functional trade-offs in foraging efficiency, resulting in populations composed of individual dietary specialists. The degree to which niche specialization persists within a population is plastic and responsive to fluctuating resource availability. We quantified niche overlap and tested the NVH within an Arctic raptor guild, focusing on three species that employ different foraging strategies: golden eagles (generalists); gyrfalcons (facultative specialists); and rough-legged hawks (specialists). Tundra ecosystems exhibit cyclic populations of arvicoline rodents (lemmings and voles), providing a unique system in which to examine predator diet in response to interannual fluctuations in resource availability. Using blood δ13C and δ15N values from 189 raptor nestlings on Alaska’s Seward Peninsula (2014–2019), we calculated isotopic niche width and used Bayesian stable isotope mixing models (BSIMMs) to characterize individual specialization and test the NVH. Nest-level specialization estimated from stable isotopes was strongly correlated with indices of specialization based on camera trap data. We observed a high degree of isotopic niche overlap between the three species and gyrfalcons displayed a positive relationship between individual specialization and population niche width on an interannual basis consistent with the NVH.

   abstract = {Permafrost, a key component of Arctic ecosystems, is currently affected by climate warming and anticipated to undergo further significant changes in this century. The most pronounced changes are expected to occur in the transition zone between the discontinuous and continuous types of permafrost. We apply a transient temperature dynamic model to investigate the spatiotemporal evolution of permafrost conditions on the Seward Peninsula, Alaska—a region currently characterized by continuous permafrost in its northern part and discontinuous permafrost in the south. We calibrate model parameters using a variational data assimilation technique exploiting historical ground temperature measurements collected across the study area. The model is then evaluated with a separate control set of the ground temperature data. Calibrated model parameters are distributed across the domain according to ecosystem types. The forcing applied to our model consists of historic monthly temperature and precipitation data and climate projections based on the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. Simulated near-surface permafrost extent for the 2000–2010 decade agrees well with existing permafrost maps and previous Alaska-wide modeling studies. Future projections suggest a significant increase (3.0°C under RCP 4.5 and 4.4°C under RCP 8.5 at the 2 m depth) in mean decadal ground temperature on average for the peninsula for the 2090–2100 decade when compared to the period of 2000–2010. Widespread degradation of the near-surface permafrost is projected to reduce its extent at the end of the 21st century to only 43% of the peninsula's area under RCP 4.5 and 8% under RCP 8.5.},

Besides explaining these large differences due to geographic and orographic location, we discuss the changes in precipitation with time. Analyzing the 18 first-order National Weather Service stations, we found that the total average precipitation in the state increased by 17% over the last 67 years. The observed changes in precipitation are furthermore discussed as a function of the observed temperature increase of 2.1 °C, the mean temperature change of the 18 stations over the same period. This observed warming of Alaska is about three times the magnitude of the mean global warming and allows the air to hold more water vapor. Furthermore, we discuss the effect of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), which has a strong influence on both the temperature and precipitation in Alaska.},

   abstract = {Adverse weather conditions during parental care may have direct consequences for offspring production, but longer-term effects on juvenile and parental survival are less well known. We used long-term data on reproductive output, recruitment, and parental survival in northern wheatears (Oenanthe oenanthe) to investigate the effects of rainfall during parental care on fledging success, recruitment success (juvenile survival), and parental survival, and how these effects related to nestling age, breeding time, habitat quality, and parental nest visitation rates. While accounting for effects of temperature, fledging success was negatively related to rainfall (days > 10 mm) in the second half of the nestling period, with the magnitude of this effect being greater for breeding attempts early in the season. Recruitment success was, however, more sensitive to the number of rain days in the first half of the nestling period. Rainfall effects on parental survival differed between the sexes; males were more sensitive to rain during the nestling period than females. We demonstrate a probable mechanism driving the rainfall effects on reproductive output: Parental nest visitation rates decline with increasing amounts of daily rainfall, with this effect becoming stronger after consecutive rain days. Our study shows that rain during the nestling stage not only relates to fledging success but also has longer-term effects on recruitment and subsequent parental survival. Thus, if we want to understand or predict population responses to future climate change, we need to consider the potential impacts of changing rainfall patterns in addition to temperature, and how these will affect target species' vital rates. In this study we show that rainfall during parental care not only reduce fledging success, but also have longer-term effects on recruitment success and parental survival, with these being age-, sex- and time-dependent. Increasing daily rainfall reduced parental nest visitation rates.},

Moreover, variation in weather had clear effects on reproductive success because nestlings exposed to inclement weather were smaller and lighter at fledging, and less likely to survive to fledging, compared to nestlings raised during good weather conditions. Prey abundance was not related to offspring size or survival. Our results suggest American Kestrels are limited by the availability, as opposed to abundance, of food on territories. It is likely that during our study, prey abundance was above some minimum threshold necessary to support successful reproduction, and so variation in weather affected reproduction more than variation in prey abundance.},

Although existing monitoring efforts are well established for both species, collaboration of activities among Arctic scientists actively involved in research of large falcons in the Nearctic and Palearctic has been poorly coordinated. Here we provide the first overview of Arctic falcon monitoring sites, present trends for long-term occupancy and productivity, and summarize information describing abundance, distribution, phenology, and health of the two species. We summarize data for 24 falcon monitoring sites across the Arctic, and identify gaps in coverage for eastern Russia, the Arctic Archipelago of Canada, and East Greenland. Our results indicate that peregrine falcon and gyrfalcon populations are generally stable, and assuming that these patterns hold beyond the temporal and spatial extents of the monitoring sites, it is reasonable to suggest that breeding populations at broader scales are similarly stable. We have highlighted several challenges that preclude direct comparisons of Focal Ecosystem Components (FEC) attributes among monitoring sites, and we acknowledge that methodological problems cannot be corrected retrospectively, but could be accounted for in future monitoring. Despite these drawbacks, ample opportunity exists to establish a coordinated monitoring program for Arctic-nesting raptor species that supports CBMP goals.},

   abstract = {Aerial insectivorous birds depend highly on favourable weather conditions for successful foraging because flight activity of insects is constrained by daily weather. Thus, the variation in weather conditions during reproduction, mediated by prey limitations, should be mirrored in annual reproduction performance, and finally in annual breeding success. We analysed the effect of local weather conditions on the availability of airborne insects and on the variation in brood size and nestling condition of European bee-eaters Merops apiaster at the northern edge of their range where years with adverse weather frequently occur. The availability of large flying insects, the common prey of bee-eaters, increased with air temperatures and duration of daily sunshine. As predicted, local weather conditions affected reproductive performance with annual breeding success (mean 3.7 nestlings per breeding pair, range 1.7–4.9 nestlings) being up to 32 % higher in extraordinary dry and hot summers. Additionally, a nest-ling’s body condition (residual mass) was also affected by sunshine duration during their growth period and internally was co-affected by the number of siblings and the individual rank within the sibling hierarchy. Thus, a prolonged duration of daily sunshine causes a cascade from higher insect flight activity, and, thus, higher food availability for chick-rearing bee-eaters, which finally translates into better chick body conditions and higher annual breeding success. Consequently reproduction and population development of European bee-eaters might be especially susceptible to regional changes in weather and climatic conditions.},

   abstract = {Extreme temperatures can injure or kill organisms and can drive evolutionary patterns. Many indices of extremes have been proposed, but few attempts have been made to establish geographic patterns of extremes and to evaluate whether they align with geographic patterns in biological vulnerability and diversity. To examine these issues, we adopt the CLIMDEX indices of thermal extremes. We compute scores for each index on a geographic grid during a baseline period (1961–1990) and separately for the recent period (1991–2010). Heat extremes (temperatures above the 90th percentile during the baseline period) have become substantially more common during the recent period, particularly in the tropics. Importantly, the various indices show weak geographic concordance, implying that organisms in different regions will face different forms of thermal stress. The magnitude of recent shifts in indices is largely uncorrelated with baseline scores in those indices, suggesting that organisms are likely to face novel thermal stresses. Organismal tolerances correlate roughly with absolute metrics (mainly for cold), but poorly with metrics defined relative to local conditions. Regions with high extreme scores do not correlate closely with regions with high species diversity, human population density, or agricultural production. Even though frequency and intensity of extreme temperature events have – and are likely to have – major impacts on organisms, the impacts are likely to be geographically and taxonomically idiosyncratic and difficult to predict.},

Numerous studies report that the Arctic is warming either twice, more than twice, or even three times as fast as the globe on average. Here we show, by using several observational datasets which cover the Arctic region, that during the last 43 years the Arctic has been warming nearly four times faster than the globe, which is a higher ratio than generally reported in literature. We compared the observed Arctic amplification ratio with the ratio simulated by state-of-the-art climate models, and found that the observed four-fold warming ratio over 1979–2021 is an extremely rare occasion in the climate model simulations. The observed and simulated amplification ratios are more consistent with each other if calculated over a longer period; however the comparison is obscured by observational uncertainties before 1979. Our results indicate that the recent four-fold Arctic warming ratio is either an extremely unlikely event, or the climate models systematically tend to underestimate the amplification.},

Increased concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases have driven Arctic and global average warming1,4; however, the underlying causes of Arctic amplification remain uncertain. The roles of reductions in snow and sea ice cover5-7 and changes in atmospheric and oceanic circulation8-10, cloud cover and water vapour 11,12 are still matters of debate. A better understanding of the processes responsible for the recent amplified warming is essential for assessing the likelihood, and impacts, of future rapid Arctic warming and sea ice loss13,14. Here we show that the Arctic warming is strongest at the surface during most of the year and is primarily consistent with reductions in sea ice cover. Changes in cloud cover, in contrast, have not contributed strongly to recent warming. Increases in atmospheric water vapour content, partly in response to reduced sea ice cover, may have enhanced warming in the lower part of the atmosphere during summer and early autumn. We conclude that diminishing sea ice has had a leading role in recent Arctic temperature amplification. The findings reinforce suggestions that strong positive ice-temperature feedbacks have emerged in the Arctic15, increasing the chances of further rapid warming and sea ice loss, and will probably affect polar ecosystems, ice-sheet mass balance and human activities in the Arctic 2. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

   abstract = {From a societal, weather, and climate perspective, precipitation intensity, duration, frequency, and phase are as much of concern as total amounts, as these factors determine the disposition of precipitation once it hits the ground and how much runs off. At the extremes of precipitation incidence are the events that give rise to floods and droughts, whose changes in occurrence and severity have an enormous impact on the environment and society. Hence, advancing understanding and the ability to model and predict the character of precipitation is vital but requires new approaches to examining data and models. Various mechanisms, storms and so forth, exist to bring about precipitation. Because the rate of precipitation, conditional on when it falls, greatly exceeds the rate of replenishment of moisture by surface evaporation, most precipitation comes from moisture already in the atmosphere at the time the storm begins, and transport of moisture by the storm-scale circulation into the storm is vital. Hence, the intensity of precipitation depends on available moisture, especially for heavy events. As climate warms, the amount of moisture in the atmosphere, which is governed by the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, is expected to rise much faster than the total precipitation amount, which is governed by the surface heat budget through evaporation. This implies that the main changes to be experienced are in the character of precipitation: increases in intensity must be offset by decreases in duration or frequency of events. The timing, duration, and intensity of precipitation can be systematically explored via the diurnal cycle, whose correct simulation in models remains an unsolved challenge of vital importance in global climate change. Typical problems include the premature initiation of convection, and precipitation events that are too light and too frequent. These challenges in observations, modeling, and understanding precipitation changes are being taken up in the NCAR "Water Cycle Across Scales" initiative, which will exploit the diurnal cycle as a test bed for a hierarchy of models to promote improvements in models.},

The assessment focuses on land regions excluding Antarctica. Changes in marine extremes are addressed in Chapter 9 and Cross-Chapter Box 9.1. Assessments of past changes and their drivers are from 1950 onward, unless indicated otherwise. Projections for changes in extremes are presented for different levels of global warming, supplemented with information for the conversion to emissions scenario-based projections (Cross- Chapter Box 11.1 and Table 4.2). Since the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), there have been important new developments and knowledge advances on changes in weather and climate extremes, in particular regarding human influence on individual extreme events, on changes in droughts, tropical cyclones, and compound events, and on projections at different global warming levels (1.5°C–4°C).

   abstract = {Inclement weather can negatively affect breeding birds directly by exposure to factors such as severe temperature and rainfall, or indirectly by reducing food supply. During a three-year study of Arctic peregrine falcons Falco peregrinus tundrius breeding in Nunavut, Canada, we estimated annual prey density at a biologically relevant scale (i.e. the home range of breeding pairs), and examined the manner in which prey density and within-season weather conditions influenced occupancy of breeding sites, egg-laying, hatch rate, prey delivery rates and growth and survivability of nestlings. The first two summers of our study (2010–2011) were warm and dry, while the third summer (2012) was cool and wet, and was preceded by a severe spring rain event. We found that occupancy of breeding sites was consistently high. As a proportion of the number of eggs laid, hatch rate did not change among years, but the number of eggs laid per occupied site declined in the third year of the study. In the first two years of the study, the number of nestlings per occupied sited was high, but declined in the third year. Total prey density at the home range scale was similar in 2010 and 2012, while the highest prey density was recorded in 2011. Total prey delivery rates to nestlings and nestling growth rates were significantly lower in 2012, which received more precipitation than 2010 and 2011. Nestling growth rates were similar in 2010 and 2011, but were markedly different in 2012; for both sexes the period of rapid growth was of shorter duration in 2012 and asymptotic weights were lower. This research contributes to the growing body of evidence that indicates severe rain events and ongoing periods of wet weather can reduce reproductive output of Arctic-breeding raptors regardless of whether it occurs during laying, incubation or brood rearing.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Unpredictable and inclement weather is increasing in strength and frequency, challenging organisms to respond adaptively. One way in which animals respond to environmental challenges is through the secretion of glucocorticoid stress hormones. These hormones mobilize energy stores and suppress non-essential physiological and behavioral processes until the challenge passes. To investigate the effects of glucocorticoids on reproductive decisions, we experimentally increased corticosterone levels (the primary glucocorticoid in birds) in free-living female tree swallows, Tachycineta bicolor, during the chick-rearing stage. Due to an unprecedented cold and wet breeding season, 90 % of the nests in our study population failed, which created a unique opportunity to test how challenging environmental conditions interact with the physiological mechanisms underlying life-history trade-offs.\n\nRESULTS: We found that exogenous corticosterone influenced the regulation of parental decisions in a context-dependent manner. Control and corticosterone-treated females had similar brood failure rates under unfavorable conditions (cold and rainy weather), but corticosterone treatment hastened brood mortality under more favorable conditions. Higher female nest provisioning rates prior to implantation were associated with increased probability of brood survival for treatment and control groups. However, higher pre-treatment male provisioning rates were associated with increased survival probability in the control group, but not the corticosterone-treated group.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal complex interactions between weather, female physiological state, and partner parental investment. Our results also demonstrate a causal relationship between corticosterone concentrations and individual reproductive behaviors, and point to a mechanism for why naturally disturbed populations, which experience multiple stressors, could be more susceptible and unable to respond adaptively to changing environmental conditions.},

Psychological science has been at the forefront of tackling these issues, with discussions about replication failures and scientific self-criticisms of questionable research practices (QRPs) increasingly taking place in public forums. How this replicability crisis impacts the public’s trust is a question yet to be answered by research. Whereas some researchers believe that the public’s trust will be positively impacted or maintained, others believe trust will be diminished. Because it is our field of expertise, we focus on trust in psychological science. We performed a study testing how public trust in past and future psychological research would be impacted by being informed about (i) replication failures (replications group), (ii) replication failures and criticisms of QRPs (QRPs group), and (iii) replication failures, criticisms of QRPs, and proposed reforms (reforms group). Results from a mostly European sample (N = 1129) showed that, compared to a control group, people in the replications, QRPs, and reforms groups self-reported less trust in past research. Regarding trust in future research, the replications and QRPs groups did not significantly differ from the control group. Surprisingly, the reforms group had less trust in future research than the control group. Nevertheless, people in the replications, QRPs, and reforms groups did not significantly differ from the control group in how much they believed future research in psychological science should be supported by public funding.

   abstract = {Background: Sexual segregation in vertebrate foraging niche is often associated with sexual size dimorphism (SSD), i.e., ecological sexual dimorphism. Although foraging behavior of male and female seabirds can vary markedly, differences in isotopic (carbon, δ13C and nitrogen, δ15N) foraging niche are generally more pronounced within sexually dimorphic species and during phases when competition for food is greater. We examined ecological sexual dimorphism among sympatric nesting Pygoscelis penguins asking whether environmental variability is associated with differences in male and female prebreeding foraging niche. We predicted that all Pygoscelis species would forage sex-specifically, and that higher quality winter habitat, i.e., higher or lower sea ice coverage for a given species, would be associated with a more similar foraging niche among the sexes. Results: P2/P8 primers reliably amplified DNA of all species. On average, male Pygoscelis penguins are structurally larger than female conspecifics. However, chinstrap penguins were more sexually dimorphic in culmen and flipper features than Adélie and gentoo penguins. Adélies and gentoos were more sexually dimorphic in body mass than chinstraps. Only male and female chinstraps and gentoos occupied separate δ15N foraging niches. Strong year effects in δ15N signatures were documented for all three species, however, only for Adélies, did yearly variation in δ15N signatures tightly correlate with winter sea ice conditions. There was no evidence that variation in sex-specific foraging niche interacted with yearly winter habitat quality. Conclusion: Chinstraps were most sexually size dimorphic followed by gentoos and Adélies. Pre-breeding sex-specific foraging niche was associated with overall SSD indices across species; male chinstrap and gentoo penguins were enriched in δ15N relative to females. Our results highlight previously unknown trophic pathways that link Pygoscelis penguins with variation in Southern Ocean sea ice suggesting that each sex within a species should respond similarly in pre-breeding trophic foraging to changes in future winter habitat. © 2014 Gorman et al.},
